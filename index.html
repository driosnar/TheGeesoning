        <h1> The reason why geese are thugs</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> so lemme hit you with some facts about geese.  They are thugs and do not care about you
        the way they look at you is just a threat from the geese government.  You think that birds do not work for the Bourgeoisie.
        well geese are their hitmen, as they will take out any oppositions that stops them.  It doesnt help that they are part of endangered list so killing them isn't allowed and they abuse this priviage to do anything they like</p>
        <hr>
        <h2> Why we need to rise</h2>
        <p> they are just <strong>thugs</strong> and will walk over us unless we walk over them first</p>
        <p> thats a fact</p>
